# KDTree
A "library" anyone can use and modify to use a KDTree.
The script KD-Tree.py can be used as a library. The script demo is just to show how fast is a KD-trr for research of the closest point.
I'd recommend adding directly attributes to the Point class depending on what you need, it should make integration easier.
