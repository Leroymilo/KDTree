# KDTree
A "library" anyone can use and modify to use a K-dimensional Tree, it is optimal to search for the point closest to given coordinates among a scatter of points if the search is made multiple times on the same scatter plot. Better explanation here : https://youtu.be/BK5x7IUTIyU .

The script KDTree.py can be used as a library. The script demo is just to show how fast is a KD tree for research of the closest point.

I'd recommend adding attributes directly into the Point class depending on what you need, it should make integration easier.
