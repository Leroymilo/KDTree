# KDTree
A "library" anyone can use and modify to use a KDTree.
The script KDTree.py can be used as a library. The script demo is just to show how fast is a KD tree for research of the closest point.
I'd recommend adding attributes directly into the Point class depending on what you need, it should make integration easier.
